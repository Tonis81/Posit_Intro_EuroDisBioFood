# How to choose the best journal for your article? 

## Considerations for Choosing the Best Journal

Scope and focus
\note{Choose a journal that matches the scope and focus of your research. Read the journal's mission statement and look at previously published articles to see if your research aligns with the journal's aims and scope.}
[Example: Exposure & Health](https://www.springer.com/journal/12403/aims-and-scope?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlPWgBhDHARIsAH2xdNd30Jww5AjSuvbTBX8mKaK_wCxgW_IoGL-I_3VsryXDWBJpgCWJjjAaAu1wEALw_wcB)

Audience
\note{Consider the target audience of the journal. Who is the journal intended for? Will your research be of interest and relevance to the readership of the journal?}

Impact factor and ranking
\note{Look at the impact factor and ranking of the journal. These metrics can provide an indication of the journal's influence and reputation in the field.}
[Journal Citation Reports (JCR) - Clarivate](https://jcr.clarivate.com/)
\note{Journal Citation Reports (JCR) is a tool that provides information about academic journals in various fields of study. It is produced by Clarivate Analytics and is widely used to assess the impact of academic journals and the influence of individual articles published within them. JCR allows users to search for journals by name, subject area, or ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) and provides data such as the journal's impact factor, citation metrics, and rankings within its subject category.}

Publication timeline
\note{Consider the publication timeline of the journal. How long does it typically take for articles to be published? Does the timeline align with your publishing goals?}

Open access options: 
\note{Consider whether the journal offers open access publishing options. Open access publishing can increase the visibility and accessibility of your research.}

Submission guidelines: 
\note{Make sure you carefully review the submission guidelines for the journal. Ensure that your research meets the formatting and content requirements, as well as any other guidelines such as word limits or reference style.}

Publication fees
\note{Check if the journal charges any publication fees, such as article processing charges (APCs) or page fees. Make sure that these fees align with your budget and that you understand any potential fees upfront.}
[Example PloS ONE](https://plos.org/publish/fees/)

## Be objective about the quality of your manuscript.

- Clarity and organization of the writing
\note{The manuscript should be clear, concise, and well-organized. Ensure that your introduction is relevant to the research question and hypotheses, the methodology is sound, the results are clearly presented and analyzed, and the discussion is supported by the data.}

- Significance of the research 
\note{The research should make a significant contribution to the field and provide new insights or knowledge. It should be clear why the research is important and how it advances the field.}

- Validity and reliability of the data
\note{The data presented in the manuscript should be valid and reliable. Ensure that the data was collected and analyzed using appropriate methods and that any limitations or potential biases are addressed.}

- Conclusions and implications
\note{The conclusions of the study should be supported by the data presented and should clearly outline the implications of the research for the field.}

- Ethical considerations
\note{Ensure that the manuscript complies with ethical standards for research involving human or animal subjects, and that any potential conflicts of interest are disclosed.}

- Formatting and presentation
\notes{The manuscript should follow the guidelines of the target journal, including formatting, style, and length requirements.}

- References
\notes{The manuscript should include appropriate references to support the research and place it in the context of the field.}

- Overall impact
\note{Consider the overall impact of the manuscript, both within the specific field and more broadly, to assess its potential contribution to knowledge and its relevance to current research trends.}

## Check the publications of your teammates

- Collaborative opportunities
\notes{If your teammates have previously published in a particular journal, it may be a good opportunity for collaboration and networking.}

- Familiarity with the journal: 
\notes{Your teammates may have insights and experience with the journal's submission and review process, which can be valuable when preparing your manuscript.}

- Similar research interests: 
\notes{If your teammates have published in a journal related to your research interests, it may be a good fit for your manuscript as well.}

- Publication track record: 
\note{If your teammates have had success publishing in a particular journal, it may indicate the journal is a good choice for high-quality research.}

- Citation impact
\nots{By analyzing the citation impact of your teammate's publications in a specific journal, you can gauge the potential visibility and impact of your own publication.}

## JCR by areas

JCR (Journal Citation Reports) provides rankings of journals based on citation data. The JCR categorizes journals into different areas of research based on their subject category. Here are the main areas of research covered by the JCR and their respective subject categories:

<div style="font-size:12pt">

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my_data <- data.frame(
  Science = c("Agriculture, Biology & Environmental Sciences", "Chemistry", "Clinical Medicine", "Computer Science", "Earth & Planetary Sciences", "Engineering", "Materials Science", "Mathematics", "Neuroscience & Behavior", "Pharmacology & Toxicology", "Physics", "Psychiatry/Psychology", "Social Sciences, General", "Space Science"),
  Social_Sciences = c("Anthropology", "Economics", "Education & Educational Research", "Geography", "Information Science & Library Science", "International Relations", "Law", "Library Science", "Management", "Political Science", "Psychology, Social", "Public Administration", "Social Work", "Sociology"),
  Arts_Humanities = c("Arts & Humanities, General", "History", "Linguistics", "Geography", "Literature", "Music", "Philosophy", "Religion", "Theater & Dance", "", "", "", "", ""))

my_data %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_minimal(full_width = F, html_font = "Verdana")
```

</div>

## Knowing the journals.

- Ensures journal's scope and audience align with research topic and goals.

- Understand journal's publishing standards and guidelines for formatting, length, and style

- Insight into review process, acceptance rates, and publication timelines

- Avoid predatory journals and find reputable ones.

- Compare journal's impact factor and ranking with others in your field.

- Offers networking opportunities for greater exposure of your work.

# Open access

## Pros of publishing in open access journals:

- Increased visibility and accessibility of the article, as it can be freely accessed by anyone with an internet connection.

- Greater potential for citations and impact, as open access articles are generally more widely read and cited than articles behind paywalls.

- Ability to reach a wider audience, including researchers, students, policymakers, and the general public.
Encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing across disciplines and geographic regions.

- Can promote greater transparency in research and facilitate reproducibility.

## Cons of publishing in open access journals

- Cost of publishing fees, which can be a barrier for some researchers or institutions.

- Concerns about the quality and rigor of some open access journals, as there is no universal standard for evaluating them.

- Potential for predatory journals that charge exorbitant fees and provide little to no editorial oversight or peer review.

- Some traditional journals may not recognize open access publications as being on par with traditional publications for the purposes of promotion and tenure.

- Concerns about the long-term sustainability of open access models, as they often rely on funding from outside sources and may not generate enough revenue to support themselves.
